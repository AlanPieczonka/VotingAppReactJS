# Client for FreeCodeCamp's VotingApp project
## Big thanks to [Drakeoon](https://github.com/Drakeoon) for his assistance
### This app is still under development, therefore I  have decided not to deploy it anywhere yet
### To run
1. Run the [API](https://github.com/AlanPieczonka/VotingAppExpressJS)
2. Open terminal and run command "yarn dev"
